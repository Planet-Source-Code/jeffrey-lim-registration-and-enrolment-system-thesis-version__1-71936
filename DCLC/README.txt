.: NOTE to the Students who will use/study this program :.
----------------------------------------------------------
- The panelists were impressed and amazed by the design and capabilities of this program but unfortunately it was not defended properly. The thesis team were passed due to the fact that the system is really useful to the school. But the downside was, it was not graded based upon the software capabilities but on the performance of the defenders. And it ended not to be proud of.

 "No matter how great a thesis software is as long as the defenders (thesis defender) don't have the interest or time to study and prepare for it, it will simply in up to be less than you expected."
